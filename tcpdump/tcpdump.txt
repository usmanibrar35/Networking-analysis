tcpdump is a very useful command to inspect and capture network packets that go into and from your machine. Itâ€™s one of the most common networking utilities to troubleshoot network problems and security issues.

Although its name is tcpdump but it can be used to inspect non-TCP traffic included UDP, ARP, or ICMP.

This tutorial will show you the way to use the tcpdump command in a Linux system.







If you want to capture packets on a specific network interface and limits packet to 6, run the following command:sudo tcpdump -D


pk@pk-HP-Pro-3130-Microtower-PC:~/Desktop/analysis$ sudo tcpdump -D
1.enp2s0 [Up, Running, Connected]
2.any (Pseudo-device that captures on all interfaces) [Up, Running]
3.lo [Up, Running, Loopback]
4.bluetooth-monitor (Bluetooth Linux Monitor) [Wireless]
5.nflog (Linux netfilter log (NFLOG) interface) [none]
6.nfqueue (Linux netfilter queue (NFQUEUE) interface) [none]
7.dbus-system (D-Bus system bus) [none]
8.dbus-session (D-Bus session bus) [none]
pk@pk-HP-Pro-3130-Microtower-PC:~/Desktop/analysis$ sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -c 6
tcpdump: eth0: No such device exists
(SIOCGIFHWADDR: No such device)
